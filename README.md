This is a zip file that includes the Python Tkinter code, my documentation and the database tables which are already populated. To see how the app works, you have to:
-import the database in the Database app that you use (I used Apache)
-download and open the Python source code (I coded in VSCode because of the better interface)
-let the magic begin
